    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Updater Bot respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Support Server Logs:</strong> Updater Bot may store logs of server activities <strong>only within the official Updater Bot Support Server</strong>. This includes deleted or edited messages, moderation actions, nickname changes, role changes, joins/leaves, and channel updates. These logs are used strictly for moderation, troubleshooting, and server management purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Bot Functionality Data:</strong> To operate correctly in your server, Updater Bot collects certain configuration data, including server IDs, channel IDs, and command-specific settings. This data is stored securely in our database (MongoDB) and is used solely for bot functionality. It is <strong>not used to monitor messages or other activity outside the Support Server</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To deliver CS2 updates to the channels you configure.</li>
      <li>To maintain and improve bot performance.</li>
      <li>To support moderation and server management within the Support Server.</li>
      <li>To ensure compliance with Discordâ€™s policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share any collected data with third parties. Data is only used internally for functionality, moderation, and maintenance.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Stored configuration data and logs are kept only as long as necessary for bot functionality and server management. Logs may be deleted automatically or manually by moderators when no longer needed.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system can be 100% secure, and you use the bot at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time without prior notice. We recommend reviewing it periodically.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer via the official support server or GitHub repository.</p>
