    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>By inviting and using Updater Bot, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the bot.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must comply with Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a>. Usage of this bot is prohibited if you are banned from Discord or under the minimum age requirement set by Discord.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may not use the bot to harass, abuse, or harm others.</li>
      <li>You may not exploit the bot for malicious purposes, including spam, automation abuse, or server disruption.</li>
      <li>You agree not to reverse-engineer, modify, or attempt to clone the bot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>Updater Bot is provided “as is” without guarantees of uptime or reliability. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time without notice.</p>

    <h2>4. Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for damages, losses, or issues arising from the use of Updater Bot. By using the bot, you agree that you do so at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>5. Logging & Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Updater Bot collects and stores certain data for two main purposes:</p>

    <h3>Support Server Logs</h3>
    <p>For moderation, troubleshooting, and server management purposes, Updater Bot may log certain activities <strong>only within the official Updater Bot Support Server</strong>, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deleted or edited messages (content, author, channel, timestamp)</li>
      <li>User joins and leaves</li>
      <li>Nickname and username changes</li>
      <li>Role changes performed by moderators</li>
      <li>Moderation actions such as bans, kicks, and warnings</li>
      <li>Channel creation, deletion, and updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These logs are stored securely within the server and are accessible only to authorized moderators or bot administrators.</p>

    <h3>Bot Functionality Data</h3>
    <p>To operate properly, Updater Bot also stores certain server-specific configuration data in a secure database, such as server IDs, channel IDs, and command-related settings. This data is used solely to ensure the bot functions correctly in each server and is <strong>not used for monitoring user activity or content outside the Support Server</strong>.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
